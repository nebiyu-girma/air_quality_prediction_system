Air Quality Prediction System for Sustainable Cities
Project Overview
This project addresses Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by developing a machine learning system to predict urban air quality. Air pollution is a critical challenge in urban areas, contributing to health issues and climate change. This solution helps cities make data-driven decisions about pollution control and public health warnings.

Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Realistic urban air quality dataset with 17 features

Comprehensive EDA: Visual analysis of air quality patterns and correlations

Machine Learning Models: 4 regression algorithms for AQI prediction

Clustering Analysis: Identifies urban pollution patterns

Ethical Framework: Bias analysis and fairness considerations

Sustainability Assessment: SDG alignment and impact metrics
